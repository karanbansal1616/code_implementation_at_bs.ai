# code_implementation_at_bs.ai
It includes all the codes that I ran myself and also edited them according to the need of the project.
Above attached are the files that i used most often , there are other files but they were less used.
The above main not run individualy if you want to run you can visit https://github.com/MikulasZelinka/pyfiction.git for full implementation.

The files which we used mainly to see how our text game worked was **lstm_online.py** . It showed how we our going through the selected game by giving input to it. We recieved rewards according to the state we visited.

We can see our main model in **ssaqn_agent.py**. We can see how our model was built and procedure it follows. We edited it according to our convinience.

We can our generalisation python script at **generalisation.py** and can see how are we generalising our model based on training with other games.

You can see various game simulator in **simulator python files**. From that you can come to how are game built and processed.

We mainly edited the  **ssaqn_agent.py* and **generalisation.py** for our project of GENERIC AI.

We edited like we created and deleted the layers in  **ssaqn_agent.py** and then trained the model to see the outcomes.

We vary the no. of episodes in the **generalisation.py** file to see how will our model train and what will be the result if we change the no. of games or no. of episodes, or no. of epochs etc.

We also added new things in the model to see the outcomes of our model like **autoencoders,latent space ,tcav etc** .
